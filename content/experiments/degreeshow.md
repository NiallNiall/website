I stumbled upon an image of the back-up crew of Apollo 11. I liked the fact that they were so close to being part of one of the 21st centuryâ€™s most important moments, but instead were given miniature rockets.

So I painted some portraits of them, and went out to the country early one morning to give them their own send-off.
