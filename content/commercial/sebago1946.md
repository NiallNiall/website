Created while at elements, I designed the logo and branding for Sebago’s ’1946′ sub-brand. Celebrating the birth of the company in 1946, the limited-edition collection was vintage themed and highly premium.
I created a logo featuring vintage elements, and followed the branding the whole way through from swingtags to shoebox.
