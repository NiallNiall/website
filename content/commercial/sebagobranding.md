Alongside the creative director at Elements, I designed an emblem to represent the whole Sebago brand, incorporating their values of Americana, handsewn craftsmanship, and marine lifestyle. Brought together with the image of the 6 states of New England, their home on the east coast of America.

The logo was rolled out across their whole branding, currently finding pride of place fronting their store on Londonâ€™s famous regent street.
