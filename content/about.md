Hi there, my name is Niall.

I'm a multidisciplinary designer working professionally since 2009, in that time shifting from print to digital to motion. Currently the Lead Motion Designer at pebble {code}.

I live and work in London.

Somewhere between Javascript, After Effects, and HTML.

This website was made with Metalsmith, Gulp, and Sass.
